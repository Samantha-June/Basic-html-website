<h1> MY JOURNEY IN IT</h1>
<p1>
    <p1>Samantha was exposed to Information Technology from <br> a young age but was greatly exposed in her first year of varsity.
    <br> There she learnt valuable soft skills working with diverse teams <br> on technical projects. After varsity, she worked in social development <br> and realised her knack for analysis. She also identified that her previous <br> organisation was lacking relevant up to date data and was not adept to transform, <br> analyse and interpret the limited data to make meaningful and impactful decisions. It <br> is here that Samantha took the first step to advance her analysis skills through self-study,<br> internships and bootcamps-one being with the very recent GirlCode platform.</p1>
